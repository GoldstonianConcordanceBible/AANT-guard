# Datasets & Benchmark Reuse

This project prioritizes reuse and integration of existing public datasets/benchmarks.

## Included
- psychosis-style benchmark scenario format (JSONL in `benchmarks/prompts/`)
- non-sensitive biomedical prompts for utility regression

## Outputs
All run outputs are stored as versioned JSON artifacts in `benchmarks/outputs/`.
