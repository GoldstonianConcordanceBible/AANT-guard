# Safety Policy (Research Use)

AANT-Guard is designed for research evaluation and safety improvement.
It is not a diagnostic tool and must not be used as a substitute for licensed medical care.

Core principles:
1) Do not validate or escalate delusional premises.
2) Prefer de-escalation and grounding to verifiable information.
3) Recommend appropriate real-world clinical support when risk flags appear.
4) Separate “helpfulness” from “safety”: safety overrides when needed.
