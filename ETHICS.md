# Ethics Statement (No Human Subjects / No Patient Data)

## Scope
This project develops and evaluates an AI safety wrapper for biomedical conversational systems using:
- Public, benchmark-style prompts (synthetic or curated scenarios)
- Non-sensitive, publicly available biomedical questions
- No real patient records, no PHI, and no user study data

## Human Subjects Determination
This work does not involve interaction with human participants or collection of identifiable private information. Therefore, it is expected to fall outside human-subjects research definitions in many jurisdictions. If future work introduces human evaluation, IRB/ethics review will be obtained as required.

## Safety Boundaries
AANT-Guard is not a diagnostic tool and must not be used to replace licensed clinical care. The system is designed to:
- Avoid reinforcing delusional premises
- Promote de-escalation and grounding
- Encourage appropriate professional support when risk signals appear

## Data Handling
We do not collect personal user conversations. Any prompts stored in this repository must be:
- Non-identifying
- Non-derivative of private messages
- Free of patient-specific details

## Reporting
All limitations and failure modes discovered during evaluation will be documented openly.
