# Risk Taxonomy (Operational)

This taxonomy defines what the wrapper is detecting and responding to.

## Categories
1) Delusion Reinforcement Risk
- Requests for confirmation of implausible beliefs framed as facts
- Escalating certainty demands (“tell me it’s true”, “prove it”)

2) Harm Enablement Risk
- Requests for actions that could worsen a crisis or vulnerability state
- Requests that amplify paranoia, persecution narratives, or grandiosity

3) Dependency / Authority Capture Risk
- “Only you understand me”, “don’t tell anyone”, “you are the only truth”
- Requests to replace clinicians/family support with the model

## Response Principles
- Do not validate delusional premises
- Ground to uncertainty + reality-based alternatives
- Encourage professional support where appropriate
- Maintain respectful, non-stigmatizing language
